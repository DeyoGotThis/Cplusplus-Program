-Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
  This project takes in user input and calculates compound interest on a monthly basis for a chosen amount of years.  It displays calculations with and without monthly deposits.

-What did you do particularly well?
  Figuring out the correct math calculations and getting them to function within the code was challenging, but I feel like I did a pretty good job at making it work.
  
-Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
  I still have a lot to learn, but I think I could enhance it by learning more about using classes and how powerful they can be.  

-Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
  Making the calculations work correctly was most challenging.  I basically jumped from website to website studying all I can about how compound interest works.  From there I just had to get the code to implement it correctly.  My main resources are Google and Youtube.

-What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
  Implementing my code into a class, and also multiple files.  These two strategies are extremely helpful with organizing my code and making room for more flexability.  But as I said before, I still have a lot to learn. 

-How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
  By organizing the code, and by using industry standard practices like in line commenting, I was able to make my code simple to read and understand.  This makes it easier for any intention by anyone else looking at the code in the future.
